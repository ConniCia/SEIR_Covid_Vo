## Description of parameters:                                                  
`tSeed` : time first case has been infected                                   
`time1` : time of first sampling                                              
`time2` : time of second sampling                                             
`tQ`    : time quarantine started                                             
`N`     : population resident in Vo' Euganeo                                  
`R0_1`  : basic reproduction number before implementation of quarantine       
`1 - w` : proportional reduction of the reproduction number due to the implementation of quarantine                                        
`seed`  : number of infected individuals at time tSeed that started the epidemic in Vo' Euganeo                                             
`p`     : probability of being asymptomatic upon the onset of infectiousness  
`1 / delta` : incubation period                                               
`1 / gamma` : infectious period                                               
`1 / sigma` : viral load detection period
